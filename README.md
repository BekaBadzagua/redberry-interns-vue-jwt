# JWT Vue3

I created this application as a guideline for Redberry interns.

There is also [Laravel Api](https://github.com/BekaBadzagua/redberry-interns-laravel-jwt-api) application, Which serves as an Api for this project. 
This is a simple app where user can register and log in. also authorized user is able to fetch movies from api, and go on the /user page, where the personal information is provided.
